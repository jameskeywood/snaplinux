# Snap Linux
A lightweight, Arch based Linux distribution focusing on simplicity.

To install the ISO image for this distribution, check out www.sourceforge.com/projects/snaplinux. The build files used with archiso can also be found at this URL.

This is a fun project of mine that I have always wanted to try, and will hopefully improve as time goes on! If there are any bugs or any improvements that you would like to see, please contact me at snaplinux.help@gmail.com or contact me at my twitter handle @snaplinux.
